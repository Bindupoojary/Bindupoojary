ðŸŒ¸ Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

Iâ€™m really glad youâ€™re here âœ¨

This is where I explore, build, and share the things Iâ€™m learning along the way from backend logic and data workflows to creative side projects that keep me curious.

Here youâ€™ll find:
ðŸ§© Projects Iâ€™ve been building, experimenting with, or contributing to
ðŸ“˜ Notes and insights from challenges Iâ€™ve solved (and the ones still teaching me something)
ðŸŒ¿ A bit of motivation for anyone balancing learning, deadlines, and everyday chaos

Iâ€™m all about learning in public figuring things out one commit at a time and hopefully making tech feel a little more human.

So stick around, explore, and letâ€™s keep growing together one repo, one idea at a time ðŸ’»ðŸŒ±
